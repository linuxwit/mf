# Implement upstream connection to PHP-FPM
# "phpfpm" here is a name for this upstream connection, which you can customize
# I create a custom upstream connection per vhost, to better segregate PHP processes by vhost
# To do the same, you need a unique upstream name, and a unique filename for your php5-fpm.sock file
upstream phpfpm {
    #server unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
    #avoid sockets for nginx-fpm on Linux, they are good for BSD
